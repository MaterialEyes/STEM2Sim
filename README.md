# STEM2Sim_TMP

## Turtorial to start with Image Retrieval

### 1. Prerequsition:

Download the Atomagined dataset from https://github.com/MaterialEyes/atomagined


### 2. Reference to start with:

[1] A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations

http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j/chen20j.pdf


[2] Supervised Contrastive Learning

https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/d89a66c7c80a29b1bdbab0f2a1a94af8-Abstract.html


[3] Self-supervised Learning: Generative or Contrastive

### 3. set up virtual environment (if it does not work, install package manually follow the list in the STEM2Sim.yml file)

```bash
conda env create -f STEM2Sim.yml
``` 


### 4. run the demo-test.ipynb to validate if the installed virtual environment works

### 5. play with demo-train.ipynb for model training
